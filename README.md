# hello-world
I am learning how to use GitHub to collaborate on projects and just to appreciate the artwork of great minds!
A bit about myself, so that collaborators may understand where I am coming from and better exercise their patience.
I grew up in a very deprived region of the world, which hardened me up for all kinds of challenges. Had insatiable thirst for knowledge, but not channeled for effective specialization. After basic school, I learned French, Russian and engineering structures. Work situation was challenging in Ghana, so I went to Europe and studied environmental engineering and got a diploma in applied ICT. I didn't work in my fields of study, but mainly as an administrator in NGO's. I am very interested in ICT projects.
